        <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
</div>

    <div id="instructions">

        <h1>Instructions :</h1>
        <ol id="list">
            <li>Prepare the Chicken: Rinse the chicken thighs under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. This helps the coating stick better.</li>
            <li>Season the Chicken: Season the chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper. Allow them to marinate while you prepare the coating.</li>
            <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Prepare Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Dredge in Flour: Take each chicken thigh and dip it into the flour mixture, coating it thoroughly. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
            <li>Dip in Egg Mixture: Next, dip the floured chicken into the egg mixture, ensuring it is well coated.</li>
            <li>Final Flour Coating: Return the chicken to the flour mixture for a second coating, pressing lightly to adhere the flour mixture firmly to the chicken.</li>
            <li>Heat Oil: In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, pour enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan by about 1 inch. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). You can test if the oil is hot enough by dropping a small amount of flour into it; it should sizzle immediately.</li>
            <li>Fry Chicken in Batches: Carefully place the coated chicken thighs skin-side down in the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pan; fry in batches if necessary.</li>
            <li>Cooking Time: Fry the chicken for about 10-12 minutes on the first side until it’s golden brown and crispy. Use tongs to flip the chicken and cook for another 10-12 minutes on the other side. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).</li>
            <li>Drain Excess Oil: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve: Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken moist and tender. Serve with your favorite dipping sauces, like ranch or honey mustard.</li>

            <li>Heat the Oil: Pour enough oil into a deep skillet or pan to cover the squid rings. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). You can test the oil by dropping a small amount of flour in; it should sizzle immediately.</li>
            <li>Fry the Squid: Carefully place the coated squid rings into the hot oil in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 2-3 minutes or until they turn golden and crispy. Do not overcook, as squid can become rubbery.</li>
            <li>Drain Excess Oil: Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried calamari from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>

        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>

</div>

<div id="instructionscorn">

    <h1>Instructions :</h1>
    <ol id="list">
        <li>Preheat the Grill: Preheat your grill to medium heat, approximately 350°F (175°C). If using a charcoal grill, ensure the coals are hot and evenly distributed. If using a gas grill, set it to medium.</li>
        <li>IPrepare the Butter Mixture: In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, olive oil, salt, and pepper. The olive oil helps prevent the butter from burning while grilling and adds flavor. Adjust the seasoning to your taste—add more salt if needed for a savory kick.</li>
        <li>Brush the Corn: Husk the ears of corn, removing all the silk strands. Pat the corn dry if needed. Brush each ear of corn generously with the butter and oil mixture, ensuring all sides are well-coated. This helps the corn to char evenly and prevents it from sticking to the grill.</li>
        <li>PGrill the Corn: Place the corn directly on the preheated grill. Allow the corn to cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning the cobs every 2-3 minutes to ensure even cooking and char. You’ll notice the kernels start to darken and char slightly, giving the corn that signature smoky flavor. The corn should be tender when poked with a fork.</li>
        <li>TOnce the corn is evenly charred and fully cooked, remove it from the grill and place it on a serving plate. Sprinkle fresh chopped parsley on top for a pop of color and additional flavor (optional).</li>
        <li>Garnish with Citrus: Serve the grilled corn hot, accompanied by lime or lemon wedges. Squeezing fresh lime or lemon juice over the corn adds a refreshing citrusy contrast to the smoky, buttery flavor.</li>

        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
</div>

<div id="instructionspork">

    <h1>Instructions :</h1>
    <ol id="list">
        <li>Prepare the Pork: If using pork shoulder, cut it into thick pieces (about 1-inch thick). If using pork chops, make sure they are well-trimmed of excess fat. Pat the pork dry with paper towels to ensure it absorbs the marinade well.</li>
        <li>Make the Marinade: In a medium-sized bowl, combine soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice (or apple cider vinegar), minced garlic, paprika, ground black pepper, salt, oregano, and chili flakes (if using). Whisk the marinade ingredients together until well blended.</li>
        <li>Marinate the Pork: Place the pork in the marinade and ensure each piece is fully coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the pork and marinade into a zip-lock bag. Let the pork marinate for at least 30 minutes </li>
        <li>Preheat the Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 375-400°F or 190-200°C). If using a charcoal grill, let the coals turn ashy and distribute them evenly for even cooking. Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Grill the Pork: Remove the pork from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Place the pork pieces directly on the grill. Grill the pork for about 5-6 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the meat. You want the pork to develop a nice sear and char marks. Avoid flipping the pork too often to allow for proper caramelization.</li>
        <li>Rest the Pork: Remove the pork from the grill and place it on a clean plate. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute within the meat, ensuring tenderness.</li>
        <li>Serve: Slice the pork into serving pieces or leave it whole, and serve with your favorite side dishes like grilled vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.</li>

<div id="instructionstomato">

    <h1>Instructions :</h1>
    <ol id="list">
        <li>Heat the Olive Oil: Place a large pot over medium heat and add the olive oil. Let the oil heat up for a minute until it shimmers but doesn't smoke.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Onion: Add the chopped onion to the pot. Sauté the onion for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it becomes soft and translucent. Be careful not to let it brown; you want it to become tender but not caramelized.</li>
        <li>Add Garlic: Once the onion is soft, add the minced garlic. Stir continuously for about 1 minute. Garlic can burn quickly, so keep an eye on it, cooking just until it becomes fragrant. </li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes and Broth: Pour in the diced tomatoes with their juice, followed by the vegetable broth. Stir to combine everything. If you prefer a slightly sweeter tomato soup, add 1 teaspoon of sugar at this point to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. You can adjust this to taste as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Season with Salt and Pepper: Add a generous pinch of salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning as needed. You can always add more salt and pepper later, but it's good to season early to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Adjust Seasoning: Taste the soup once again and adjust the salt, pepper, or sugar to your liking. You can also add a pinch of chili flakes for a bit of heat if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls and serve hot. Garnish with a drizzle of olive oil, extra fresh basil, or a swirl of cream for presentation. Pair it with crusty bread or a grilled cheese sandwich for a complete meal.</li>

<div id="instructionssoup">

    <h1>Instructions :</h1>
    <ol id="list">
        <li>Heat Olive Oil: Place a large pot over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Let it warm up for about a minute until shimmering, but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Vegetables: Add the chopped onion, sliced carrots, and sliced celery to the pot. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until they become soft and slightly translucent. The onions should turn golden but not brown.</li>
        <li>Add Garlic and Thyme: Once the vegetables are softened, add the minced garlic and thyme to the pot. Stir continuously for about 1 minute, allowing the garlic to release its aroma. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can turn bitter. </li>
        <li>Add Chicken Broth: Pour in the chicken broth. Stir to combine the broth with the sautéed vegetables and seasonings. Increase the heat to high, bringing the broth to a boil. The broth is the foundation of the soup, so make sure it’s flavorful—if you want a richer taste, you can use homemade chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Cook the Noodles: Once the broth is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the egg noodles (or your pasta of choice) to the broth. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions, usually around 6-8 minutes, until tender but still firm (al dente). Stir occasionally to prevent the noodles from sticking together.</li>
        <li>Season the Soup: Taste the soup and season with salt and pepper to your liking. Adjust the seasoning as needed based on your taste. If the soup needs a little brightness, you can add a splash of lemon juice for a fresh citrus note.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once the noodles are cooked and the soup is hot, remove the pot from heat. Ladle the chicken noodle soup into bowls and garnish with freshly chopped parsley. The parsley adds a pop of color and a fresh herbaceous flavor that complements the soup.</li>

<div id="instructionsquash">

    <h1>Instructions :</h1>
    <ol id="list">
        <li>Prepare the Squash: Start by peeling the butternut squash with a vegetable peeler. Once peeled, cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds using a spoon. Dice the squash into 1-inch cubes to ensure even cooking. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat Olive Oil: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Let it warm up until shimmering, but not smoking. This should take about a minute.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Onion: Add the chopped onion to the pot and sauté for about 5-7 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. The onion adds sweetness and depth to the soup.</li>
        <li>Add Garlic and Cumin: Add the minced garlic and ground cumin (if using) to the pot. Stir continuously for about 1 minute, allowing the garlic to become fragrant and the cumin to release its warm aroma. Be careful not to let the garlic burn, as it can become bitter.</li>
        <li>Blend the Soup: Once the squash is tender, remove the pot from the heat. Use an immersion blender to carefully puree the soup directly in the pot until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, transfer the soup to a regular blender in batches, blending until smooth. Be cautious when blending hot liquids—leave the blender lid slightly ajar and cover with a towel to prevent pressure buildup.</li>
        <li>Serve: Ladle the butternut squash soup into bowls. For a beautiful presentation, drizzle a bit of coconut milk or cream on top in a swirl pattern. Garnish with roasted pumpkin seeds, croutons, or a sprinkle of fresh herbs like parsley or thyme for added texture and flavor.</li>
